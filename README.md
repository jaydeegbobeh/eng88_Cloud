# Cloud Computing
The on demand delivery of computing resources.

## Advantages of cloud computing
- Scalable - you can scale up and down and this allows flexibility for a business.
- Reliable - back ups can be created
- Mobile - you can access the cloud anywhere, provided you have an internet connection and there is a server in the country.

## Disadvantages of cloud computing
- Technical issues: lack of data portability between providers and if the server is down, you have to wait for the provider to fix it.
- Security is a big issue: data loss/ theft, data leakage, account and service hijacking, technology vulnerabilities.
- The physical data server is not accessible to you so there's no transparency (you must rely on the provider to inform you where the data is being stored).

## Cloud deployment models
- Public: owned and operated by a 3rd party, rent access to cloud - AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google.
- Private: used exclusively by a business and it's usually located witin the company (e.g bank ,government) or they might rent space at a provider for their own server.
- Hybrid: some resources on public and some on private e.g Netflix.

## Cloud service types
- Infrastucture as a Service (IaaS): contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide access to networking features, computers and data storage space.
- Platform as a Service (PaaS): removes the need for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure (hardware and operating systems) and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of applications.
- Software as a Service (SaaS): provides a completed products that is run and managed by the service provider.

## Cloud computing vs virtualisation
Virtualisation is a technology that allows you to create multiple simulated environments or resources from a single physical hardware system.
Clouds are IT environments that abstract, pool and share scalable resources across a network.
